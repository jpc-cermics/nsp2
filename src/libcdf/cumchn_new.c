 * @x: upper limit of integration of the non-central chi-square distribution.
 * @nu: degrees of freedom of the non-central chi-square distribution. 
 * @lambda: non-centrality parameter of the non-central chi-square distribution.
 * @cum: cumulative non-central chi-square distribution. 
 * @ccum:  compliment of cumulative non-central chi-square distribution
 * 
 *     calculates     the       cumulative      non-central    chi-square 
 *     distribution, i.e.,  the probability   that  a   random   variable 
 *     which    follows  the  non-central chi-square  distribution,  with 
 *     non-centrality  parameter lambda  and   continuous  degrees   of 
 *     freedom nu, is less than or equal to x. 
 * 
 *  This code uses the same method than the Dcdflib cumchn but with various
 *  improvments:
 *
 *   - for large x (in fact x larger than the mean) we compute Q = 1 - P in
 *     place of P with the corresponding  26.4.25 serie for Q (see comments 
 *     inside the code). So we have a better accuracy (at least for Q) and P 
 *     goes to 1 smoothly (in the old code for very large X, P was stick at 
 *     a value under 1).  This lets the inverse function to be computed more 
 *     accurately for P near 1 (that is Q near 0)
 *
 *   - initials terms of the serie which are of Poisson probabilities
 *     are computed with the C. Loader dpois_raw function.
 *
 *   - stopping test is slightly different, the new code don't use sum < 1e-20
 *     to stop the iterations (the test  sum < 1e-20 leads to some inacuracy 
 *     in the relative error for small P)
 *
 *   - for x far enough the mean (we choose mean +- 50*std) set directly
 *     P,Q to (1,0) and (0,1)
 *
 *   - Nan are handled explicitely
 *
 *   - for small non centrality parameter we use 26.4.27 of Abramowitz and Stegun
 *     in place of approximate non central chisquare directly by the central 
 *     chisquare. 
 *
 *   - add display of a warning message in the nsp console if the serie
 *     is stopped by itermax instead of relative accuracy test (itermax
 *     is also changed to 10000, was 1000 in the old code). 
 *
 *   - the new code is more readable than the old one (at least for me).
 *
 *  This code have tested with the pari-gp software and seems to be quite
 *  accurate in a very large domain for both x, df and pnonc parameters
 *  (relative accuracy under 1e-13 and most of the time about 1e-14).

       *
       *   starting the sum from term in which the poisson weight (= exp(-lambda/2) ( (lambda/2)^j / j! )
       *   is greatest (j=jmode) and goes backward then forward
       *
       *   for x <= nu + lambda choose (1) and otherwise (2)
       *
       *   Using formula (3) or (4) to update the needed chisquare probability is done this way :
       *
       *   Starting with   Pc(x, nu + 2*jmode), we have using (4):
       *
       *     Pc(x, nu + 2*(jmode+1)) =  Pc(x, nu + 2*jmode) - (x/2)^{nu/2+jmode} exp(-x/2) / Gamma(nu/2+jmode+1)
       *
       *    So we need the term  cor := (x/2)^{nu/2+jmode} exp(-x/2) / Gamma(nu/2+jmode+1) := cor(jmode->jmode+1)
       *
       *    but other corrections terms are got from cor with an easy recurrence:
       * 
       *      cor(j -> j+1) = (x/2)/(nu/2+j+1) cor(j-1 -> j)
