ipmpar and spmpar were changed to use lapack machine constant computation
dlamch + ipmpar1.c (largestint) in calelm 
psi and dexpm1 were renamed not to conflict with other entries 


The following routines come from Toms708 
They have the ACM Copyright. They have 
to be rewriten. 

    * In bratio.c 
      * apse yields the incomplete beta ratio i(sub(1-x))(b,a) for
      * basym uses an asymptotic expansion for ix(a,b) for large a and b.
      * BFRAC uses a continued fraction expansion for ix(a,b) when a,b .gt. 1.
      * BGRAT uses an asymptotic expansion for ix(a,b) when a is larger than b.
      * BPSER uses the power series expansion for evaluating ix(a,b) when b .le. 1
      * BUP evaluates ix(a,b) - ix(a+n,b) where n is a positive integer.
      * BRATIO evaluates the incomplete beta function Ix(A,B).
      * FPSER evaluates Ix(A,B) for small B and X <= 0.5.
    * used only in bratio
      * GRAT1 evaluates the incomplete gamma ratio functions p(a,x) and q(a,x).
      * BRCMP1 evaluates exp(mu) * (x**a*y**b/beta(a,b))
         * ESUM evaluates exp(mu + x).
      * BRCOMP evaluates X**a * y**b / beta(a,b)

    * BETALN evaluates the logarithm of the beta function.
    * ERFC1 evaluates the complementary error function
    * ERF evaluates the real error function.
    * EXPARG reports the largest safe arguments for EXP(X).

Rewriten code:
