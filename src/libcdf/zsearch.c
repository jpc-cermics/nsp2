/*
 *   This routine may replace the old dinvr.c routine from
 *   cdflib (translated in C by Jpc). dinvr is a search routine 
 *   for bracketing a zero of a function f and when done it uses 
 *   dzror to find accurately a zero of f (Notes that nsp_zsearch 
 *   contains internally the "dzror part"). This second part 
 *   (find accurately a bracketed zero of f) is done using :
 *     Algorithm R of the paper 'Two Efficient Algorithms with
 *     Guaranteed Convergence for Finding a Zero of a Function'
 *     by J. C. P. Bus and T. J. Dekker in ACM Transactions on
 *     Mathematical Software, Volume 1, no. 4 page 330
 *     (Dec. '75)
 *
 *   Both dinvr and nsp_zsearch work using "reverse communication"
 *   which means that they don't compute internally f(x) (no
 *   function pointer is provided to the routine) but
 *   asks a caller loop to compute f on x until success or failure.
 *   (see "how to use this stuff" for an example).
 *    
 *   There are slight differences between this new routine 
 *   (nsp_zsearch) and dinvr which results in :
 *      * 3 or 4 f evaluations avoided with nsp_zsearch
 *        (moreover nsp_zsearch is also faster due to its
 *         structure).
 *      * nsp_zsearch code is hopefully better understandable
 *      * in some cases nsp_zsearch can find a zero where dinvr
 *        fails. 
 *
 *   The main difference is the following: dinvr searches on the
 *   interval [left_bound, right_bound] and first evaluates f on 
 *   x = left_bound and x = right_bound to determine the "monotonicity" 
 *   of the function. Then it starts from x = xinit and depending 
 *   on f(xinit) and on the "monotonicity" searches on the left or 
 *   on the right trying to bracket a zero. When a bracket interval 
 *   [b, c] is found  dinvr calls dzror but without using the fact 
 *   that the function is known at b and c (so there are 2 supplementary 
 *   call to f).
 *
 *   nsp_zsearch can be called by specifying the function monotonicity
 *   (INCREASING, DECREASING, UNKNOWN). In case the monotonicity is
 *   known (INCREASING, DECREASING), the search direction can be determined 
 *   once f(xinit) has been computed. Otherwise a first positive step is 
 *   done and f(xinit) and f(xinit + step) are used to determine the 
 *   (somewhat local) monotonicity. Moreover if the first search fails 
 *   the other direction is tried. In case the function is such that 
 *   f(left_bound) and f(right_bound) are together positive or negative, 
 *   dinvr stops but not nsp_zsearch which can search on the whole
 *   [left_bound, right_bound] interval. So can work when f 
 *   is not a monotone function. dinvr was sometimes used this way, in
 *   particular:
 * 
 *   [p,q]=cdff("PQ", 7.460435, 5, 7);
 *    f=cdff("F", 5, 7, p, q);
 *    cdff("Dfn", 7, p, q, f)  // => bug
 *
 *   The explanation is that the function is not monotone
 *   and that 
 *
 *    dfn = linspace(0.00001,7,5000)';
 *    v = ones(size(dfn));
 *    [p,q]=cdff("PQ", 7.460435*v, dfn, 7*v);
 *    plot2d(dfn,p,style=2)
 *
 *   and there are 2 possible values for dfn. On this particular
 *   case nsp_zsearch finds one of the 2 roots (5).  
 *
 *   how to use this stuff:
 *   ----------------------
 *
 *   ZsearchStruct S;
 *   double x = xinit;
 *   stat = nsp_zsearch_init(x, left_bound, right_bound, absstp, relstp, stpmul, 
 *		             abstol, reltol, monotonicity, &S)
 *   do
 *     {
 *        fx = f(x);  compute f on x
 *     }
 *    while ( (ret_val = nsp_zsearch(&x, fx, &S)) == EVAL_FX );
 *
 *    switch( ret_val )
 *      {
 *      case SUCCESS:
 *         x is the approximated root (additionnal information in S)
 *         break;
 *      case LEFT_BOUND_EXCEEDED:
 *         the search (on the left from xinit) was not able to bracket a zero
 *         (which doesn't mean that there is not a zero...)
 *         break;
 *      case RIGHT_BOUND_EXCEEDED:
 *         the search (on the right from xinit) was not able to bracket a zero
 *         (which doesn't mean that there is not a zero...)
 *         break;
 *      case BOTH_BOUND_EXCEEDED:
 *         this case is got when monotonicity = UNKNOWN and the search
 *         part fails to bracket a zero.(which doesn't mean that there is not a zero...)
 *         break;
 *      }
 *
