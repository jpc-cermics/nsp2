;; A queue curve: i.e a circular queue used 
;; to store points of a curve of oscilloscope type
;; main difficulty here: the maximum number of points which 
;; are kept depends on the size of Pts. 
;; For a scicos oscilloscope it should depend on the 
;; refresh period which is an amount of time 
;; i.e we should be able to dynamically resize the queue 
;; if necessary.
