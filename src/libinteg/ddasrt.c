   * 
   * 
   * 
   **Arguments: 
   * 
   * RES:EXT  This is a subroutine which you provide to define the 
   *          differential/algebraic system. 
   * 
   * NEQ:IN  This is the number of equations to be solved. 
   * 
   * T:INOUT  This is the current value of the independent variable. 
   * 
   * Y(*):INOUT  This array contains the solution components at T. 
   * 
   * YPRIME(*):INOUT  This array contains the derivatives of the solution 
   *                  components at T. 
   * 
   * TOUT:IN  This is a point at which a solution is desired. 
   * 
   * INFO(N):IN  The basic task of the code is to solve the system from T 
   *             to TOUT and return an answer at TOUT.  INFO is an int 
   *             array which is used to communicate exactly how you want 
   *             this task to be carried out.  N must be greater than or 
   *             equal to 15. 
   * 
   * RTOL,ATOL:INOUT  These quantities represent absolute and relative 
   *                  error tolerances which you provide to indicate how 
   *                  accurately you wish the solution to be computed. 
   *                  You may choose them to be both scalars or else 
   *                  both vectors. 
   * 
   * IDID:OUT  This scalar quantity is an indicator reporting what the 
   *           code did.  You must monitor this int variable to decide 
   *           what action to take next. 
   * 
   * RWORK:WORK  A real work array of length LRW which provides the 
   *              code with needed storage space. 
   * 
   * LRW:IN  The length of RWORK. 
   * 
   * IWORK:WORK  An int work array of length LIW which probides the 
   *              code with needed storage space. 
   * 
   * LIW:IN  The length of IWORK. 
   * 
   * RPAR,IPAR:IN  These are real and int parameter arrays which 
   *               you can use for communication between your calling 
   *               program and the RES subroutine (and the JAC subroutine) 
   * 
   * JAC:EXT  This is the name of a subroutine which you may choose to 
   *          provide for defining a matrix of partial derivatives 
   *          described below. 
   * 
   * G  This is the name of the subroutine for defining 
   *    constraint functions, G(T,Y), whose roots are desired 
   *    during the integration.  This name must be declared 
   *    external in the calling program. 
   * 
   * NG  This is the number of constraint functions G(I). 
   *     If there are none, set NG=0, and pass a dummy name 
   *     for G. 
   * 
   * JROOT  This is an int array of length NG for output 
   *        of root information. 
   * 
   * 
   **Description 
   * 
   * QUANTITIES WHICH MAY BE ALTERED BY THE CODE ARE 
   *    T,Y(*),YPRIME(*),INFO(1),RTOL,ATOL, 
   *    IDID,RWORK(*) AND IWORK(*). 
   * 
   * Subroutine DDASRT uses the backward differentiation formulas of 
   * orders one through five to solve a system of the above form for Y and 
   * YPRIME.  Values for Y and YPRIME at the initial time must be given as 
   * input.  These values must be consistent, (that is, if T,Y,YPRIME are 
   * the given initial values, they must satisfy F(T,Y,YPRIME) = 0.).  The 
   * subroutine solves the system from T to TOUT. 
   * It is easy to continue the solution to get results at additional 
   * TOUT.  This is the interval mode of operation.  Intermediate results 
   * can also be obtained easily by using the intermediate-output 
   * capability.  If DDASRT detects a sign-change in G(T,Y), then 
   * it will return the intermediate value of T and Y for which 
   * G(T,Y) = 0. 
   * 
   * ---------INPUT-WHAT TO DO ON THE FIRST CALL TO DDASRT--------------- 
   * 
   * 
   * The first call of the code is defined to be the start of each new 
   * problem. Read through the descriptions of all the following items, 
   * provide sufficient storage space for designated arrays, set 
   * appropriate variables for the initialization of the problem, and 
   * give information about how you want the problem to be solved. 
   * 
   * 
   * RES -- Provide a subroutine of the form 
   *            SUBROUTINE RES(T,Y,YPRIME,DELTA,IRES,RPAR,IPAR) 
   *        to define the system of differential/algebraic 
   *        equations which is to be solved. For the given values 
   *        of T,Y and YPRIME, the subroutine should 
   *        return the residual of the defferential/algebraic 
   *        system 
   *            DELTA = F(T,Y,YPRIME) 
   *        (DELTA(*) is a vector of length NEQ which is 
   *        output for RES.) 
   * 
   *        Subroutine RES must not alter T,Y or YPRIME. 
   *        You must declare the name RES in an external 
   *        statement in your program that calls DDASRT. 
   *        You must dimension Y,YPRIME and DELTA in RES. 
   * 
   *        IRES is an int flag which is always equal to 
   *        zero on input. Subroutine RES should alter IRES 
   *        only if it encounters an illegal value of Y or 
   *        a stop condition. Set IRES = -1 if an input value 
   *        is illegal, and DDASRT will try to solve the problem 
   *        without getting IRES = -1. If IRES = -2, DDASRT 
   *        will return control to the calling program 
   *        with IDID = -11. 
   * 
   *        RPAR and IPAR are real and int parameter arrays which 
   *        you can use for communication between your calling program 
   *        and subroutine RES. They are not altered by DDASRT. If you 
   *        do not need RPAR or IPAR, ignore these parameters by treat- 
   *        ing them as dummy arguments. If you do choose to use them, 
   *        dimension them in your calling program and in RES as arrays 
   *        of appropriate length. 
   * 
   * NEQ -- Set it to the number of differential equations. 
   *        (NEQ .GE. 1) 
   * 
   * T -- Set it to the initial point of the integration. 
   *      T must be defined as a variable. 
   * 
   * Y(*) -- Set this vector to the initial values of the NEQ solution 
   *         components at the initial point. You must dimension Y of 
   *         length at least NEQ in your calling program. 
   * 
   * YPRIME(*) -- Set this vector to the initial values of 
   *              the NEQ first derivatives of the solution 
   *              components at the initial point. You 
   *              must dimension YPRIME at least NEQ 
   *              in your calling program. If you do not 
   *              know initial values of some of the solution 
   *              components, see the explanation of INFO(11). 
   * 
   * TOUT - Set it to the first point at which a solution 
   *        is desired. You can not take TOUT = T. 
   *        integration either forward in T (TOUT .GT. T) or 
   *        backward in T (TOUT .LT. T) is permitted. 
   * 
   *        The code advances the solution from T to TOUT using 
   *        step sizes which are automatically selected so as to 
   *        achieve the desired accuracy. If you wish, the code will 
   *        return with the solution and its derivative at 
   *        intermediate steps (intermediate-output mode) so that 
   *        you can monitor them, but you still must provide TOUT in 
   *        accord with the basic aim of the code. 
   * 
   *        the first step taken by the code is a critical one 
   *        because it must reflect how fast the solution changes near 
   *        the initial point. The code automatically selects an 
   *        initial step size which is practically always suitable for 
   *        the problem. By using the fact that the code will not step 
   *        past TOUT in the first step, you could, if necessary, 
   *        restrict the length of the initial step size. 
   * 
   *        For some problems it may not be permissable to integrate 
   *        past a point TSTOP because a discontinuity occurs there 
   *        or the solution or its derivative is not defined beyond 
   *        TSTOP. When you have declared a TSTOP point (SEE INFO(4) 
   *        and RWORK(1)), you have told the code not to integrate 
   *        past TSTOP. In this case any TOUT beyond TSTOP is invalid 
   *        input. 
   * 
   * INFO(*) - Use the INFO array to give the code more details about 
   *           how you want your problem solved. This array should be 
   *           dimensioned of length 15, though DDASRT uses 
   *           only the first eleven entries. You must respond to all of 
   *           the following items which are arranged as questions. The 
   *           simplest use of the code corresponds to answering all 
   *           questions as yes, i.e. setting all entries of INFO to 0. 
   * 
   *      INFO(1) - This parameter enables the code to initialize 
   *             itself. You must set it to indicate the start of every 
   *             new problem. 
   * 
   *         **** Is this the first call for this problem ... 
   *               Yes - Set INFO(1) = 0 
   *                No - Not applicable here. 
   *                     See below for continuation calls.  **** 
   * 
   *      INFO(2) - How much accuracy you want of your solution 
   *             is specified by the error tolerances RTOL and ATOL. 
   *             The simplest use is to take them both to be scalars. 
   *             To obtain more flexibility, they can both be vectors. 
   *             The code must be told your choice. 
   * 
   *         **** Are both error tolerances RTOL, ATOL scalars ... 
   *               Yes - Set INFO(2) = 0 
   *                     and input scalars for both RTOL and ATOL 
   *                No - Set INFO(2) = 1 
   *                     and input arrays for both RTOL and ATOL **** 
   * 
   *      INFO(3) - The code integrates from T in the direction 
   *             of TOUT by steps. If you wish, it will return the 
   *             computed solution and derivative at the next 
   *             intermediate step (the intermediate-output mode) or 
   *             TOUT, whichever comes first. This is a good way to 
   *             proceed if you want to see the behavior of the solution. 
   *             If you must have solutions at a great many specific 
   *             TOUT points, this code will compute them efficiently. 
   * 
   *         **** Do you want the solution only at 
   *               TOUT (and not at the next intermediate step) ... 
   *                Yes - Set INFO(3) = 0 
   *                 No - Set INFO(3) = 1 **** 
   * 
   *      INFO(4) - To handle solutions at a great many specific 
   *             values TOUT efficiently, this code may integrate past 
   *             TOUT and interpolate to obtain the result at TOUT. 
   *             Sometimes it is not possible to integrate beyond some 
   *             point TSTOP because the equation changes there or it is 
   *             not defined past TSTOP. Then you must tell the code 
   *             not to go past. 
   * 
   *          **** Can the integration be carried out without any 
   *               restrictions on the independent variable T ... 
   *                Yes - Set INFO(4)=0 
   *                 No - Set INFO(4)=1 
   *                      and define the stopping point TSTOP by 
   *                      setting RWORK(1)=TSTOP **** 
   * 
   *      INFO(5) - To solve differential/algebraic problems it is 
   *             necessary to use a matrix of partial derivatives of the 
   *             system of differential equations. If you do not 
   *             provide a subroutine to evaluate it analytically (see 
   *             description of the item JAC in the call list), it will 
   *             be approximated by numerical differencing in this code. 
   *             although it is less trouble for you to have the code 
   *             compute partial derivatives by numerical differencing, 
   *             the solution will be more reliable if you provide the 
   *             derivatives via JAC. Sometimes numerical differencing 
   *             is cheaper than evaluating derivatives in JAC and 
   *             sometimes it is not - this depends on your problem. 
   * 
   *          **** Do you want the code to evaluate the partial 
   *               derivatives automatically by numerical differences ... 
   *                  Yes - Set INFO(5)=0 
   *                   No - Set INFO(5)=1 
   *                 and provide subroutine JAC for evaluating the 
   *                 matrix of partial derivatives **** 
   * 
   *      INFO(6) - DDASRT will perform much better if the matrix of 
   *             partial derivatives, DG/DY + CJ*DG/DYPRIME, 
   *             (here CJ is a scalar determined by DDASRT) 
   *             is banded and the code is told this. In this 
   *             case, the storage needed will be greatly reduced, 
   *             numerical differencing will be performed much cheaper, 
   *             and a number of important algorithms will execute much 
   *             faster. The differential equation is said to have 
   *             half-bandwidths ML (lower) and MU (upper) if equation i 
   *             involves only unknowns Y(J) with 
   *                            I-ML .LE. J .LE. I+MU 
   *             for all I=1,2,...,NEQ. Thus, ML and MU are the widths 
   *             of the lower and upper parts of the band, respectively, 
   *             with the main diagonal being excluded. If you do not 
   *             indicate that the equation has a banded matrix of partial 
   *             derivatives, the code works with a full matrix of NEQ**2 
   *             elements (stored in the conventional way). Computations 
   *             with banded matrices cost less time and storage than with 
   *             full matrices if 2*ML+MU .LT. NEQ. If you tell the 
   *             code that the matrix of partial derivatives has a banded 
   *             structure and you want to provide subroutine JAC to 
   *             compute the partial derivatives, then you must be careful 
   *             to store the elements of the matrix in the special form 
   *             indicated in the description of JAC. 
   * 
   *         **** Do you want to solve the problem using a full 
   *              (dense) matrix (and not a special banded 
   *              structure) ... 
   *               Yes - Set INFO(6)=0 
   *                No - Set INFO(6)=1 
   *                      and provide the lower (ML) and upper (MU) 
   *                      bandwidths by setting 
   *                      IWORK(1)=ML 
   *                      IWORK(2)=MU **** 
   *

   *  RTOL, ATOL -- You must assign relative (RTOL) and absolute (ATOL

   *              as variables because the code may change them. You

   *                    Both RTOL and ATOL are scalars. (INFO(2)=0)

   *              in either case all components must be non-negative. 
   * 
   *              The tolerances are used by the code in a local error 
   *              test at each step which requires roughly that 
   *                    ABS(LOCAL ERROR) .LE. RTOL*ABS(Y)+ATOL 
   *              for each vector component. 
   *              (More specifically, a root-mean-square norm is used to 
   *              measure the size of vectors, and the error test uses the 
   *              magnitude of the solution at the beginning of the step.) 
   * 
   *              The true (global) error is the difference between the 
   *              true solution of the initial value problem and the 
   *              computed approximation. Practically all present day 
   *              codes, including this one, control the local error at 
   *              each step and do not even attempt to control the global 
   *              error directly. 
   *              Usually, but not always, the true accuracy of the 
   *              computed Y is comparable to the error tolerances. This 
   *              code will usually, but not always, deliver a more 
   *              accurate solution if you reduce the tolerances and 
   *              integrate again. By comparing two such solutions you 
   *              can get a fairly reliable idea of the true error in the 
   *              solution at the bigger tolerances. 
   * 
   *              Setting ATOL=0. results in a pure relative error test on 
   *              that component. Setting RTOL=0. results in a pure 
   *              absolute error test on that component. A mixed test 
   *              with non-zero RTOL and ATOL corresponds roughly to a 
   *              relative error test when the solution component is much 
   *              bigger than ATOL and to an absolute error test when the 
   *              solution component is smaller than the threshhold ATOL. 
   * 
   *              The code will not attempt to compute a solution at an 
   *              accuracy unreasonable for the machine being used. It 
   *              will advise you if you ask for too much accuracy and

   * G -- This is the name of the subroutine for defining constraint 
   *              functions, whose roots are desired during the 
   *              integration.  It is to have the form 
   *                  SUBROUTINE G(NEQ,T,Y,NG,GOUT,RPAR,IPAR) 
   *                  DIMENSION Y(NEQ),GOUT(NG), 
   *              where NEQ, T, Y and NG are INPUT, and the array GOUT is 
   *              output.  NEQ, T, and Y have the same meaning as in the 
   *              RES routine, and GOUT is an array of length NG. 
   *              For I=1,...,NG, this routine is to load into GOUT(I) 
   *              the value at (T,Y) of the I-th constraint function G(I). 
   *              DDASRT will find roots of the G(I) of odd multiplicity 
   *              (that is, sign changes) as they occur during 
   *              the integration.  G must be declared EXTERNAL in the 
   *              calling program. 
   * 
   *              CAUTION..because of numerical errors in the functions 
   *              G(I) due to roundoff and integration error, DDASRT 
   *              may return false roots, or return the same root at two 
   *              or more nearly equal values of T.  If such false roots 
   *              are suspected, the user should consider smaller error 
   *              tolerances and/or higher precision in the evaluation of 
   *              the G(I). 
   * 
   *              If a root of some G(I) defines the end of the problem, 
   *              the input to DDASRT should nevertheless allow 
   *              integration to a point slightly past that ROOT, so 
   *              that DDASRT can locate the root by interpolation. 
   * 
   * NG -- The number of constraint functions G(I).  If there are none, 
   *              set NG = 0, and pass a dummy name for G. 
   * 
   *JROOT -- This is an int array of length NG.  It is used only for 
   *              output.  On a return where one or more roots have been 
   *              found, JROOT(I)=1 If G(I) has a root at T, 
   *              or JROOT(I)=0 if not. 
   * 
   * 
   * 
   * OPTIONALLY REPLACEABLE NORM ROUTINE: 
   * DDASRT uses a weighted norm DDANRM to measure the size 
   * of vectors such as the estimated error in each step. 
   * A FUNCTION subprogram 
   *   DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION DDANRM(NEQ,V,WT,RPAR,IPAR) 
   *   DIMENSION V(NEQ),WT(NEQ) 
   * is used to define this norm. Here, V is the vector 
   * whose norm is to be computed, and WT is a vector of 
   * weights.  A DDANRM routine has been included with DDASRT 
   * which computes the weighted root-mean-square norm 
   * given by 
   *   DDANRM=SQRT((1/NEQ)*SUM(V(I)/WT(I))**2) 
   * this norm is suitable for most problems. In some 
   * special cases, it may be more convenient and/or 
   * efficient to define your own norm by writing a function 
   * subprogram to be called instead of DDANRM. This should 
   * ,however, be attempted only after careful thought and 
   * consideration. 
   * 
   * 
   *------OUTPUT-AFTER ANY RETURN FROM DDASRT----

   *  INPUT -- What to do to continue the integration 
   *           (calls after the first)                ** 
   * 
   *    This code is organized so that subsequent calls to continue the 
   *    integration involve little (if any) additional effort on your 
   *    part. You must monitor the IDID parameter in order to determine 
   *    what to do next. 
   * 
   *    Recalling that the principal task of the code is to integrate 
   *    from T to TOUT (the interval mode), usually all you will need 
   *    to do is specify a new TOUT upon reaching the current TOUT. 
   * 
   *    Do not alter any quantity not specifically permitted below, 
   *    in particular do not alter NEQ,T,Y(*),YPRIME(*),RWORK(*),IWORK(*) 
   *    or the differential equation in subroutine RES. Any such 
   *    alteration constitutes a new problem and must be treated as such, 
   *    i.e., you must start afresh. 
   * 
   *    You cannot change from vector to scalar error control or vice 
   *    versa (INFO(2)), but you can change the size of the entries of 
   *    RTOL, ATOL. Increasing a tolerance makes the equation easier 
   *    to integrate. Decreasing a tolerance will make the equation 
   *    harder to integrate and should generally be avoided. 
   * 
   *    You can switch from the intermediate-output mode to the 
   *    interval mode (INFO(3)) or vice versa at any time. 
   * 
   *    If it has been necessary to prevent the integration from going 
   *    past a point TSTOP (INFO(4), RWORK(1)), keep in mind that the 
   *    code will not integrate to any TOUT beyond the currently 
   *    specified TSTOP. Once TSTOP has been reached you must change 
   *    the value of TSTOP or set INFO(4)=0. You may change INFO(4) 
   *    or TSTOP at any time but you must supply the value of TSTOP in 
   *    RWORK(1) whenever you set INFO(4)=1. 
   * 
   *    Do not change INFO(5), INFO(6), IWORK(1), or IWORK(2) 
   *    unless you are going to restart the code. 
   * 
   *                   *** Following a completed task *** 
   *    If 
   *    IDID = 1, call the code again to continue the integration 
   *                 another step in the direction of TOUT. 
   * 
   *    IDID = 2 or 3, define a new TOUT and call the code again. 
   *                 TOUT must be different from T. You cannot change 
   *                 the direction of integration without restarting. 
   * 
   *    IDID = 4, call the code again to continue the integration 
   *                 another step in the direction of TOUT.  You may 
   *                 change the functions in G after a return with IDID=4, 
   *                 but the number of constraint functions NG must remain 
   *                 the same.  If you wish to change 
   *                 the functions in RES or in G, then you 
   *                 must restart the code. 
   * 
   *                   *** Following an interrupted task *** 
   *                 To show the code that you realize the task was 
   *                 interrupted and that you want to continue, you 
   *                 must take appropriate action and set INFO(1) = 1 
   *    If 
   *    IDID = -1, The code has taken about 500 steps. 
   *                 If you want to continue, set INFO(1) = 1 and 
   *                 call the code again. An additional 500 steps 
   *                 will be allowed. 
   * 
   *    IDID = -2, The error tolerances RTOL, ATOL have been 
   *                 increased to values the code estimates appropriate 
   *                 for continuing. You may want to change them 
   *                 yourself. If you are sure you want to continue 
   *                 with relaxed error tolerances, set INFO(1)=1 and 
   *                 call the code again. 
   * 
   *    IDID = -3, A solution component is zero and you set the 
   *                 corresponding component of ATOL to zero. If you 
   *                 are sure you want to continue, you must first 
   *                 alter the error criterion to use positive values 
   *                 for those components of ATOL corresponding to zero 
   *                 solution components, then set INFO(1)=1 and call 
   *                 the code again. 
   * 
   *    IDID = -4,-5  --- Cannot occur with this code. 
   * 
   *    IDID = -6, Repeated error test failures occurred on the 
   *                 last attempted step in DDASRT. A singularity in the 
   *                 solution may be present. If you are absolutely 
   *                 certain you want to continue, you should restart 
   *                 the integration. (Provide initial values of Y and 
   *                 YPRIME which are consistent) 
   * 
   *    IDID = -7, Repeated convergence test failures occurred 
   *                 on the last attempted step in DDASRT. An inaccurate 
   *                 or ill-conditioned JACOBIAN may be the problem. If 
   *                 you are absolutely certain you want to continue, you 
   *                 should restart the integration. 
   * 
   *    IDID = -8, The matrix of partial derivatives is singular. 
   *                 Some of your equations may be redundant. 
   *                 DDASRT cannot solve the problem as stated. 
   *                 It is possible that the redundant equations 
   *                 could be removed, and then DDASRT could 
   *                 solve the problem. It is also possible 
   *                 that a solution to your problem either 
   *                 does not exist or is not unique. 
   * 
   *    IDID = -9, DDASRT had multiple convergence test 
   *                 failures, preceeded by multiple error 
   *                 test failures, on the last attempted step. 
   *                 It is possible that your problem 
   *                 is ill-posed, and cannot be solved 
   *                 using this code. Or, there may be a 
   *                 discontinuity or a singularity in the 
   *                 solution. If you are absolutely certain 
   *                 you want to continue, you should restart 
   *                 the integration. 
   * 
   *   IDID =-10, DDASRT had multiple convergence test failures 
   *                 because IRES was equal to minus one. 
   *                 If you are absolutely certain you want 
   *                 to continue, you should restart the 
   *                 integration. 
   * 
   *   IDID =-11, IRES=-2 was encountered, and control is being 
   *                 returned to the calling program. 
   * 
   *   IDID =-12, DDASRT failed to compute the initial YPRIME. 
   *              This could happen because the initial 
   *              approximation to YPRIME was not very good, or 
   *              if a YPRIME consistent with the initial Y 
   *              does not exist. The problem could also be caused 
   *              by an inaccurate or singular iteration matrix. 
   * 
   * 
   * 
   *    IDID = -13,..,-32 --- Cannot occur with this code. 
   * 
   *                      *** Following a terminated task *** 
   *    If IDID= -33, you cannot continue the solution of this 
   *                 problem. An attempt to do so will result in your 
   *                 run being terminated.

   *THIS SUBROUTINE FINDS THE LEFTMOST ROOT OF A SET OF ARBITRARY 
   *FUNCTIONS GI(X) (I = 1,...,NG) IN AN INTERVAL (X0,X1).  ONLY ROOTS 
   *OF ODD MULTIPLICITY (I.E. CHANGES OF SIGN OF THE GI) ARE FOUND. 
   *HERE THE SIGN OF X1 - X0 IS ARBITRARY, BUT IS CONSTANT FOR A GIVEN 
   *PROBLEM, AND -LEFTMOST- MEANS NEAREST TO X0. 
   *THE VALUES OF THE VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTION G(X) = (GI, I=1...NG) 
   *ARE COMMUNICATED THROUGH THE CALL SEQUENCE OF DROOTS. 
   *THE METHOD USED IS THE ILLINOIS ALGORITHM.

   *KATHIE L. HIEBERT AND LAWRENCE F. SHAMPINE, IMPLICITLY DEFINED 
   *OUTPUT POINTS FOR SOLUTIONS OF ODE-S, SANDIA REPORT SAND80-0180, 
   *FEBRUARY, 1980. 
   * 
   *DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS. 
   * 
   *NG     = NUMBER OF FUNCTIONS GI, OR THE NUMBER OF COMPONENTS OF 
   *         THE VECTOR VALUED FUNCTION G(X).  INPUT ONLY. 
   * 
   *HMIN   = RESOLUTION PARAMETER IN X.  INPUT ONLY.  WHEN A ROOT IS 
   *         FOUND, IT IS LOCATED ONLY TO WITHIN AN ERROR OF HMIN IN X. 
   *         TYPICALLY, HMIN SHOULD BE SET TO SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 
   *              100 * UROUND * MAX(ABS(X0),ABS(X1)), 
   *         WHERE UROUND IS THE UNIT ROUNDOFF OF THE MACHINE. 
   * 
   *JFLAG  = INT FLAG FOR INPUT AND OUTPUT COMMUNICATION. 
   * 
   *         ON INPUT, SET JFLAG = 0 ON THE FIRST CALL FOR THE PROBLEM, 
   *         AND LEAVE IT UNCHANGED UNTIL THE PROBLEM IS COMPLETED. 
   *         (THE PROBLEM IS COMPLETED WHEN JFLAG .GE. 2 ON RETURN.) 
   * 
   *         ON OUTPUT, JFLAG HAS THE FOLLOWING VALUES AND MEANINGS.. 
   *         JFLAG = 1 MEANS DROOTS NEEDS A VALUE OF G(X).  SET GX = G(X) 
   *                   AND CALL DROOTS AGAIN. 
   *         JFLAG = 2 MEANS A ROOT HAS BEEN FOUND.  THE ROOT IS 
   *                   AT X, AND GX CONTAINS G(X).  (ACTUALLY, X IS THE 
   *                   RIGHTMOST APPROXIMATION TO THE ROOT ON AN INTERVAL 
   *                   (X0,X1) OF SIZE HMIN OR LESS.) 
   *         JFLAG = 3 MEANS X = X1 IS A ROOT, WITH ONE OR MORE OF THE GI 
   *                   BEING ZERO AT X1 AND NO SIGN CHANGES IN (X0,X1). 
   *                   GX CONTAINS G(X) ON OUTPUT. 
   *         JFLAG = 4 MEANS NO ROOTS (OF ODD MULTIPLICITY) WERE 
   *                   FOUND IN (X0,X1) (NO SIGN CHANGES). 
   * 
   *X0,X1  = ENDPOINTS OF THE INTERVAL WHERE ROOTS ARE SOUGHT. 
   *         X1 AND X0 ARE INPUT WHEN JFLAG = 0 (FIRST CALL), AND 
   *         MUST BE LEFT UNCHANGED BETWEEN CALLS UNTIL THE PROBLEM IS 
   *         COMPLETED.  X0 AND X1 MUST BE DISTINCT, BUT X1 - X0 MAY BE 
   *         OF EITHER SIGN.  HOWEVER, THE NOTION OF -LEFT- AND -RIGHT- 
   *         WILL BE USED TO MEAN NEARER TO X0 OR X1, RESPECTIVELY. 
   *         WHEN JFLAG .GE. 2 ON RETURN, X0 AND X1 ARE OUTPUT, AND 
   *         ARE THE ENDPOINTS OF THE RELEVANT INTERVAL. 
   * 
   *G0,G1  = ARRAYS OF LENGTH NG CONTAINING THE VECTORS G(X0) AND G(X1), 
   *         RESPECTIVELY.  WHEN JFLAG = 0, G0 AND G1 ARE INPUT AND 
   *         NONE OF THE G0(I) SHOULD BE BE ZERO. 
   *         WHEN JFLAG .GE. 2 ON RETURN, G0 AND G1 ARE OUTPUT. 
   * 
   *GX     = ARRAY OF LENGTH NG CONTAINING G(X).  GX IS INPUT 
   *         WHEN JFLAG = 1, AND OUTPUT WHEN JFLAG .GE. 2. 
   * 
   *X      = INDEPENDENT VARIABLE VALUE.  OUTPUT ONLY. 
   *         WHEN JFLAG = 1 ON OUTPUT, X IS THE POINT AT WHICH G(X) 
   *         IS TO BE EVALUATED AND LOADED INTO GX. 
   *         WHEN JFLAG = 2 OR 3, X IS THE ROOT. 
   *         WHEN JFLAG = 4, X IS THE RIGHT ENDPOINT OF THE INTERVAL, X1. 
   * 
   *JROOT  = INT ARRAY OF LENGTH NG.  OUTPUT ONLY. 
   *         WHEN JFLAG = 2 OR 3, JROOT INDICATES WHICH COMPONENTS 
   *         OF G(X) HAVE A ROOT AT X.  JROOT(I) IS 1 IF THE I-TH 
   *         COMPONENT HAS A ROOT, AND JROOT(I) = 0 OTHERWISE. 
   * 
   *IMAX, LAST, ALPHA, X2 =
