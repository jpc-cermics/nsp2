/*     subroutine hybrj1 
 *
 *     the purpose of hybrj1 is to find a zero of a system of 
 *     n nonlinear functions in n variables by a modification 
 *     of the powell hybrid method. this is done by using the 
 *     more general nonlinear equation solver hybrj. the user 
 *     must provide a subroutine which calculates the functions 
 *     and the jacobian. 
 *
 *     the subroutine statement is 
 *
 *       subroutine hybrj1(fcn,n,x,fvec,fjac,ldfjac,tol,tolf,info,wa,lwa) 
 *
 *     where 
 *
 *       fcn is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which 
 *         calculates the functions and the jacobian. fcn must 
 *         be declared in an external statement in the user 
 *         calling program, and should be written as follows. 
 *
 *         subroutine fcn(n,x,fvec,fjac,ldfjac,iflag) 
 *         int n,ldfjac,iflag 
 *         double precision x(n),fvec(n),fjac(ldfjac,n) 
 *         ---------- 
 *         if iflag = 1 calculate the functions at x and 
 *         return this vector in fvec. do not alter fjac. 
 *         if iflag = 2 calculate the jacobian at x and 
 *         return this matrix in fjac. do not alter fvec. 
 *         --------- 
 *         return 
 *         end 
 *
 *         the value of iflag should not be changed by fcn unless 
 *         the user wants to terminate execution of hybrj1. 
 *         in this case set iflag to a negative int. 
 *
 *       n is a positive int input variable set to the number 
 *         of functions and variables. 
 *
 *       x is an array of length n. on input x must contain 
 *         an initial estimate of the solution vector. on output x 
 *         contains the final estimate of the solution vector. 
 *
 *       fvec is an output array of length n which contains 
 *         the functions evaluated at the output x. 
 *
 *       fjac is an output n by n array which contains the 
 *         orthogonal matrix q produced by the qr factorization 
 *         of the final approximate jacobian. 
 *
 *       ldfjac is a positive int input variable not less than n 
 *         which specifies the leading dimension of the array fjac. 
 *
 *       tol is a nonnegative input variable. termination occurs 
 *         when the algorithm estimates that the relative error 
 *         between x and the solution is at most tol. 
*
 *       tolf is a nonnegative input variable. termination 
 *         occurs also if Max_i |f_i(x)| <= ftol (added by Bruno).
 *
 *       info is an int output variable. if the user has 
 *         terminated execution, info is set to the (negative) 
 *         value of iflag. see description of fcn. otherwise, 
 *         info is set as follows. 
 *
 *         info = 0   improper input parameters. 
 *
 *         info = 1   algorithm estimates that the relative error 
 *                    between x and the solution is at most tol. 
 *
 *         info = 2   number of calls to fcn with iflag = 1 has 
 *                    reached 100*(n+1). 
 *
 *         info = 3   tol is too small. no further improvement in 
 *                    the approximate solution x is possible. 
 *
 *         info = 4   iteration is not making good progress. 
 *
 *       wa is a work array of length lwa. 
 *
 *       lwa is a positive int input variable not less than 
 *         (n*(n+13))/2.
