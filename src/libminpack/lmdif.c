/*     subroutine lmdif 
 *
 *     the purpose of lmdif is to minimize the sum of the squares of 
 *     m nonlinear functions in n variables by a modification of 
 *     the levenberg-marquardt algorithm. the user must provide a 
 *     subroutine which calculates the functions. the jacobian is 
 *     then calculated by a forward-difference approximation. 
 *
 *     the subroutine statement is 
 *
 *       subroutine lmdif(fcn,m,n,x,fvec,ftol,xtol,gtol,maxfev,epsfcn, 
 *                        diag,mode,factor,nprint,info,nfev,fjac, 
 *                        ldfjac,ipvt,qtf,wa1,wa2,wa3,wa4) 
 *
 *     where 
 *
 *       fcn is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which 
 *         calculates the functions. fcn must be declared 
 *         in an external statement in the user calling 
 *         program, and should be written as follows. 
 *
 *         subroutine fcn(m,n,x,fvec,iflag) 
 *         int m,n,iflag 
 *         double precision x(n),fvec(m) 
 *         ---------- 
 *         calculate the functions at x and 
 *         return this vector in fvec. 
 *         ---------- 
 *         return 
 *         end 
 *
 *         the value of iflag should not be changed by fcn unless 
 *         the user wants to terminate execution of lmdif. 
 *         in this case set iflag to a negative int. 
 *
 *       m is a positive int input variable set to the number 
 *         of functions. 
 *
 *       n is a positive int input variable set to the number 
 *         of variables. n must not exceed m. 
 *
 *       x is an array of length n. on input x must contain 
 *         an initial estimate of the solution vector. on output x 
 *         contains the final estimate of the solution vector. 
 *
 *       fvec is an output array of length m which contains 
 *         the functions evaluated at the output x. 
 *
 *       ftol is a nonnegative input variable. termination 
 *         occurs when both the actual and predicted relative 
 *         reductions in the sum of squares are at most ftol. 
 *         therefore, ftol measures the relative error desired 
 *         in the sum of squares. 
 *
 *       xtol is a nonnegative input variable. termination 
 *         occurs when the relative error between two consecutive 
 *         iterates is at most xtol. therefore, xtol measures the 
 *         relative error desired in the approximate solution. 
 *
 *       gtol is a nonnegative input variable. termination 
 *         occurs when the cosine of the angle between fvec and 
 *         any column of the jacobian is at most gtol in absolute 
 *         value. therefore, gtol measures the orthogonality 
 *         desired between the function vector and the columns 
 *         of the jacobian. 
 *
 *       maxfev is a positive int input variable. termination 
 *         occurs when the number of calls to fcn is at least 
 *         maxfev by the end of an iteration. 
 *
 *       epsfcn is an input variable used in determining a suitable 
 *         step length for the forward-difference approximation. this 
 *         approximation assumes that the relative errors in the 
 *         functions are of the order of epsfcn. if epsfcn is less 
 *         than the machine precision, it is assumed that the relative 
 *         errors in the functions are of the order of the machine 
 *         precision. 
 *
 *       diag is an array of length n. if mode = 1 (see 
 *         below), diag is internally set. if mode = 2, diag 
 *         must contain positive entries that serve as 
 *         multiplicative scale factors for the variables. 
 *
 *       mode is an int input variable. if mode = 1, the 
 *         variables will be scaled internally. if mode = 2, 
 *         the scaling is specified by the input diag. other 
 *         values of mode are equivalent to mode = 1. 
 *
 *       factor is a positive input variable used in determining the 
 *         initial step bound. this bound is set to the product of 
 *         factor and the euclidean norm of diag*x if nonzero, or else 
 *         to factor itself. in most cases factor should lie in the 
 *         interval (.1,100.). 100. is a generally recommended value. 
 *
 *       nprint is an int input variable that enables controlled 
 *         printing of iterates if it is positive. in this case, 
 *         fcn is called with iflag = 0 at the beginning of the first 
 *         iteration and every nprint iterations thereafter and 
 *         immediately prior to return, with x and fvec available 
 *         for printing. if nprint is not positive, no special calls 
 *         of fcn with iflag = 0 are made. 
 *
 *       info is an int output variable. if the user has 
 *         terminated execution, info is set to the (negative) 
 *         value of iflag. see description of fcn. otherwise, 
 *         info is set as follows. 
 *
 *         info = 0  improper input parameters. 
 *
 *         info = 1  both actual and predicted relative reductions 
 *                   in the sum of squares are at most ftol. 
 *
 *         info = 2  relative error between two consecutive iterates 
 *                   is at most xtol. 
 *
 *         info = 3  conditions for info = 1 and info = 2 both hold. 
 *
 *         info = 4  the cosine of the angle between fvec and any 
 *                   column of the jacobian is at most gtol in 
 *                   absolute value. 
 *
 *         info = 5  number of calls to fcn has reached or 
 *                   exceeded maxfev. 
 *
 *         info = 6  ftol is too small. no further reduction in 
 *                   the sum of squares is possible. 
 *
 *         info = 7  xtol is too small. no further improvement in 
 *                   the approximate solution x is possible. 
 *
 *         info = 8  gtol is too small. fvec is orthogonal to the 
 *                   columns of the jacobian to machine precision. 
 *
 *       nfev is an int output variable set to the number of 
 *         calls to fcn. 
 *
 *       fjac is an output m by n array. the upper n by n submatrix 
 *         of fjac contains an upper triangular matrix r with 
 *         diagonal elements of nonincreasing magnitude such that 
 *
 *                t     t           t 
 *               p *(jac *jac)*p = r *r, 
 *
 *         where p is a permutation matrix and jac is the final 
 *         calculated jacobian. column j of p is column ipvt(j) 
 *         (see below) of the identity matrix. the lower trapezoidal 
 *         part of fjac contains information generated during 
 *         the computation of r. 
 *
 *       ldfjac is a positive int input variable not less than m 
 *         which specifies the leading dimension of the array fjac. 
 *
 *       ipvt is an int output array of length n. ipvt 
 *         defines a permutation matrix p such that jac*p = q*r, 
 *         where jac is the final calculated jacobian, q is 
 *         orthogonal (not stored), and r is upper triangular 
 *         with diagonal elements of nonincreasing magnitude. 
 *         column j of p is column ipvt(j) of the identity matrix. 
 *
 *       qtf is an output array of length n which contains 
 *         the first n elements of the vector (q transpose)*fvec. 
 *
 *       wa1, wa2, and wa3 are work arrays of length n. 
 *
 *       wa4 is a work array of length m.
