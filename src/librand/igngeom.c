/*
 *  PURPOSE
 *     generate a random deviate from G(p) : the geometric
 *     law. If a r.v. X ~ G(p), X is the number of Bernouilli trials
 *     (B(p)) until succes is met. So X take its values in
 *
 *         {1, 2, 3, ...., } 
 *
 *     and  P(X=i) = p * (1-p)^(i-1) 
 *
 *  METHOD 
 *     inversion of the cdf leads to :
 *
 *     (1)   X = 1 + floor( log(1-u) / log(1-p) )
 *
 *     u being a random deviate from U[0,1).
 *
 *     by taking into account that 1-u follows also U(0,1)) this may be 
 *     replaced with X = ceil( log(u) / log(1-p) ) or 1 + floor(log(u)/log(1-p))
 *     which needs less work. But as ranf() provides number in [0,1[ , 0 may be 
 *     gotten and these formulae may give then +oo.
 * 
 *     With ranf() the max number is 1 - 2^(-32). This let us choose a safe min
 *     value for p (to avoid a +oo due to log(1-p)) in the following manner :
 *
 *        the max is gotten for  M = log(2^(-32)) / (-p)
 *
 *     (for very small |x|, the accurate func logp1(x):=log(1+x) return simply x)
 *
 *     and we want  M <= Rmax (near 1.798+308 in ieee 754 double)
 *
 *     so p >= 32 log(2)/Rmax which is near 1.234e-307 ; Says pmin = 1.3e-307.
 *     (anyway the results gotten for such small values of p are certainly 
 *      not meaningful...)
 *
 *  NOTE
 *     this function returns a double instead of an integer type : this is 
 *     to avoid an extra conversion because in scilab it will be a double.
 *
 *  ASSUMPTION
 *     p must be in [pmin,1]  (to do at the calling level).

/*     PURPOSE :  Compute   v = log ( (1 + s)/(1 - s) ) 
 *        for small s, this is for |s| < SLIM = 0.20 
 *     ALGORITHM : 
 *     1/ if |s| is "very small" we use a truncated 
 *        taylor dvp (by keeping 3 terms) from : 
 *                               2        4          6 
 *        t = 2 * s * ( 1 + 1/3 s  + 1/5 s  + [ 1/7 s  + ....] ) 
 *                               2        4 
 *        t = 2 * s * ( 1 + 1/3 s  + 1/5 s  + er) 
 *        The limit E until we use this formula may be simply 
 *        gotten so that the negliged part er is such that : 
 *                                    2        4 
 *        (#) er <= epsm * ( 1 + 1/3 s  + 1/5 s )   for all |s|<= E 
 *        As  er  = 1/7 s^6 + 1/9 s^8 + ... 
 *            er <= 1/7 * s^6 ( 1 + s^2 + s^4 + ...) = 1/7  s^6/(1-s^2) 
 *        the inequality (#) is forced if : 
 *        1/7  s^6 / (1-s^2)  <= epsm * ( 1 + 1/3 s^2  + 1/5 s^4 ) 
 *        s^6 <= 7 epsm * (1 - 2/3 s^2 - 3/15 s^4 - 1/5 s^6) 
 *        So that E is very near (7 epsm)^(1/6) (approximately 3.032d-3): 
 *     2/ For larger |s| we used a minimax polynome : 
 *        yi = s * (2  + d3 s^3 + d5 s^5 .... + d13 s^13 + d15 s^15) 
 *        This polynome was computed (by some remes algorithm) following 
 *        (*) the sin(x) example (p 39) of the book : 
 *         "ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS" 
 *         "Algorithms and implementation" 
 *         J.M. Muller (Birkhauser)
