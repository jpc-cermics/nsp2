//  Purpose
//  -------
//   A setdiff function for nsp: c = a - b (or c= a \ b in french notation)
//
//  Inputs
//  ------
//   a : row or column vector (*) of numbers or strings.
//       a is considered as a set of elements.
//       
//   b : row or column vector (*) of numbers or strings.
//       b must be same type than a and like a, b 
//       is considered as a set of elements.
//
//   (*) a or b could be matrices and in this case each one is considered
//       as a big column vector using the column major order.
//
//  Outputs
//  ------- 
//   c : vector with the components of a (considered as a set) which
//       are not in b ; c is a row vector if a is row vector and a
//       column vector in the other cases (that is when a is a column 
//       vector or a matrix).
//   ka: ka(i) is an index of c(i) in a, that is a(ka(i)) = c(i)
//       (a(ka) must be equal to c).
//
