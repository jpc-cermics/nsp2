% -- Parameters
\begin{parameters}
  \begin{varlist}
    \vname{file-name}: a string which gives the pathname of file to be opened. 
    Note that \verb+file-name+ can also be one of the following keywords \verb+"stdin"+, or 
    \verb+"stdout"+, or \verb+"stderr"+ in order to use the standard input, output or output error 
    stream.
    \vname{mode}: The argument \verb+mode+ is a string beginning  with  one  of  the  following  sequences
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \verb!r!: open text file for reading. The stream is positioned at
        the beginning of the file.
      \item \verb!r+!: open text file for reading and writing. The stream is
        positioned at the beginning of the file.
      \item \verb!w!: truncate file to zero length or create text file for
        writing.  The stream is positioned at the beginning of the file.
      \item \verb!w+!: open for reading and writing.  The file is created if it
        does not exist, otherwise it is truncated.  The stream is positioned at
        the beginning of the file.
      \item \verb!a!: open for appending (writing at end of file).  The file is
        created if it does not exist.  The stream is positioned at the end of
        the file.
      \item \verb!a+!: open for reading and appending (writing at end of file).
        The file is created if it does not exist.  The initial file position for
        reading is at the beginning of the file, but output is always appended
        to the end of the file.
    \end{itemize}
    The mode string can also include the letter \verb+b+ as a last character.
    Adding \verb+b+ b is used if you do I/O to a binary file (but note that
    \verb+b+ is ignored on all POSIX conforming systems, including Linux).
    \vname{swap} If true (the default value) then byte swaping is forced when
    using the \verb+get+ and \verb+put+ methods in order to have binary files
    always filed with data coded as little endian.  If \verb+swap+ is false then
    data is writen in the machine native mode.  \vname{xdr} If true then reading
    and writing is used using \verb+xdr+.
  \end{varlist}
\end{parameters}

\begin{mandescription}
The \emph{File} data type is used for file I/O operations.
\end{mandescription}

\paragraph{Operations on File objects}
\itemdesc{methods}
\begin{itemize}
  \vname{F.close[]}: close the file stream.
  \vname{F.putstr[str]}: outputs a string. 
  \vname{F.put[M,type='string']}: outputs the contents of real matrix \verb+M+ using 
  the \verb!type! parameter as a conversion specifier. The \verb+type+ argument can be chosen 
  among \verb+"l"+, \verb+"i"+, \verb+"s"+, \verb+"ul"+, \verb+"ui"+, \verb+"us"+, \verb+"d"+, \verb+"f"+, 
  \verb+"c"+,\verb+"uc"+ for writing respectively a long, an int, a short, an unsigned long, 
  an unsigned int, an unsigned short, a double, a float, a char and an unsigned char. 
  The bytes which are read are automatically swapped if necessary. 
  This default swapping mode can be suppressed by adding a flag in the \verb!mopen! function 
  (see the description of the \verb+swap+ parameter above).
  It is also possible to force read in little-endian mode or big-endian mode by adding a \verb+'l'+ or \verb+'b'+  
  character at the end of a type specification. For example \verb+'db'+ can be used to read a double 
  in big-endian mode. 
  \vname{F.get[n=val,type='string']}: reads \verb+n+ values of type given by \verb+type+ 
  (see the above \verb+put+ method for \verb+type+ specification).
  and returns the values in a vector of size \verb+n+. 
  \vname{F.getstr[n=val]}: reads \verb+n+ bytes and returns the a string.
  \vname{F.eof[]}: returns \verb+%t+ if an end-of-file was encountered. 
  \vname{F.seek[value,str]}:  sets  the  file  position indicator. The new position, 
  measured in bytes, is obtained by adding offset bytes to  the
  position  specified by \verb+str+. If \verb+str+ is set to \verb+'set'+, \verb+'cur'+, 
  \verb+'end'+ the offset is relative to the start of the file, 
  the current position indicator, or  end of file,  respectively. The default value 
  is \verb+set+.
  Successful call clears the end of file indicator.
  \vname{F.tell[]}: returns the current value of the file position indicator. 
  \vname{F.clearerr[]}: clears any previously raised error.
  \vname{F.error[]}: returns \verb+%t+ if an error was encountered during previous read/write 
  operations 
  \vname{[M,S]=F.get_matrix[]}: read a numerical matrix from file current position. 
  First lines can be non-numeric and are then returned in S. The read stops when current 
  line read is not compatible with previous ones (see  \manlink{get_matrix}{get_matrix} help page)
  \vname{S=F.get_lines[n]}: acquires \verb+n+ lines from the file stream \verb+F+ and returns 
  the result in a string matrix. If \verb+n+ is omitted it is assumed to be equal to 
  one if it is strictly negative then all the lines are acquired.
  \vname{S=F.get_smatrix[]}: read the whole file contents from current position
  and return a column string vector. Each line read giving a row of the column vector.
  \vname{F.put_matrix[M,format='string',sep='string',title=S]}: 
    output  matrix contents in a file using the given format for each element 
    and the string given by \verb+sep+ as separator. If \verb+title+ is given 
    its contents is outputed in the file before the matrix. Default value 
    for format is the default format used in nsp interactive output and default 
    separator is a white space (see  \manlink{put_matrix}{put_matrix} help page).  
  \vname{F.put_smatrix[S]}: output the contents of a string matrix in file \verb+F+ 
  the string matrix is explored columnwise (i.e equivalent to \verb+S(:)+).
  \vname{F.print[Obj,as_read=boolean,depth=integer, indent=integer,latex=boolean,name=string,table=boolean]}: 
  see the \manlink{print}{print} help page for a description of optional arguments.
  \vname{F.printf[format,arg1,...,argn]}: Similar to the C \verb+fprintf+ function. 
\end{itemize}

\itemdesc{functions}
\begin{itemize}
  \vname{fopen}: opens a file for I/O operations returning a \verb+File+ object.
  \vname{is_little_endian}: checks the little-endian machine specification.
  \vname{getfile(fname)}: gets the contents of ascii file given by \verb+fname+ 
  in a string column vector.
  \vname{putfile(fname,S)}: put the contents of a string matrix in file named 
  \verb+fname+. If the file already existed its contents is replaced, if not it is 
  created.
