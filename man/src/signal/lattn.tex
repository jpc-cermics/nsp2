%-- Parameters
\begin{parameters}
  \begin{varlist}
    \vname{n}: maximum order of the filter
    \vname{p}: fixed dimension of the MA part. If \verb!p= -1!, the algorithm reduces to the classical Levinson recursions.
    \vname{cov}: matrix containing the \verb!Rk!'s (\verb!d*d! matrices for a d-dimensional process).It must be given the following way
    \vname{la}: list-type variable, giving the successively calculated polynomials (degree 1 to degree n),with coefficients Ak
  \end{varlist}
\end{parameters}
\begin{mandescription}
  solves recursively on \verb!n! (\verb!p! being fixed)
  the following system (normal equations), i.e. identifies
  the AR part (poles) of a vector ARMA(n,p) process
  where {\verb!Rk;k=1,nlag!} is the sequence of empirical covariances
