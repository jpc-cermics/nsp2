% -- Parameters
\begin{parameters}
  \begin{varlist}
    \vname{A}: a symmetric positive definite real or complex matrix. 
    \vname{R}: an upper triangular matrix \verb+R+ such that \verb+R'*R = X+.
    \vname{p}: an integer (0 or the order of the leading minor which is 
not positive definite).
  \end{varlist}
\end{parameters}

\begin{mandescription}
This function computes the Cholesky factorization of a (full) symmetric positive 
definite real or complex matrix, or a partial factorization if the matrix is not 
positive definite (for Cholesky factorization of sparse matrices see  
\manlink{cholmod\_create}{chomod_create}).

When called as \verb+R = chol(A)+, if \verb+A+ is positive definite, an upper triangular 
matrix \verb+R+ such that \verb+R'*R = X+ is returned, if not an error exception is 
raised.

When called as \verb+[R,p]= chol(A)+ if \verb+A+ is positive definite an upper triangular 
matrix \verb+R+ such that \verb+R'*R = X+ is returned and \verb+p+ is set to zero. 
If \verb+A+ is not positive definite the order of the leading minor which is 
not positive definite is returned in \verb+p+ and the returned upper triangular matrix \verb+R+ is 
of size \verb+qxq+ where \verb+q=p-1+ and is such that \verb+R'*R=A(1:q,1:q)+.

Note that \verb+chol(A)+ only uses the the diagonal and upper triangle of $A$. 
Cholesky decomposition is based on the Lapack routines \verb+dpotrf+ for real 
matrices and \verb+zpotrf+ for the complex case.
