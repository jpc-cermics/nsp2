\begin{mandescription}
  This function may be used to generate random numbers from various distributions. In this 
  case you must apply one of the three first forms of the possible
  calling sequences to get an \verb!m x n! matrix. 
  The two firsts are equivalent if \verb!Mat! is a \verb!m x n! matrix, 
  and the third one corresponds to multivariate distributions (e.g. multinomial, multivariate
  gaussian, etc...) where a sample is a column vector (says of dim \verb!m!)
  and you get then \verb!n! such random vectors (as an \verb!m x n! matrix). 
  The last form is used to undertake various manipulations onto the base generators
  like changing the base generator or changing or retrieving its internal state (seeds), 
  etc ... These base generators give random integers following a
  uniform distribution on a large integer interval of the form $[0,n)$
  (with $n=2^{32}$ in most cases).  Others distributions are got from
  this one through various transformations.

%-- section-Set/get the current generator and its state
\paragraph{Set/get the current generator and its state}
~~\\

You have the possibility to choose between different base 
generators (which give random integers following the \verb!"lgi"!
distribution). Each one provides its own sequence which is ultimately 
periodic. By default, the sequence is started from the same fixed 
internal state and so gives the same ``random numbers'' each time you 
start nsp (see here after ``How to set ``randomly'' the initial state'' 
to change this behavior). The available base generators are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \itemdesc{mt}  the Mersenne-Twister of M. Matsumoto and T. Nishimura, period about \verb!2^19937!, 
  state given by an array of \verb!624! integers (plus an index onto this array); this  
  is the default generator.
\item \itemdesc{kiss}  The Keep It Simple Stupid of G. Marsaglia,  period about \verb!2^123!,
  state given by \verb!4! integers.
\item \itemdesc{clcg2}  a Combined 2 Linear Congruential Generator of P. L'Ecuyer,
  period about \verb!2^61!, state given by \verb!2! integers.
\item \itemdesc{clcg4}  a Combined 4 Linear Congruential Generator of P. L'Ecuyer,
  period about \verb!2^121!, state given by 4 integers ; this one is 
  splitted in \verb!101! different virtual (non over-lapping) generators 
  which may be useful for different tasks (see 'Actions specific to clcg4' and
  'Test example for clcg4').
\item \itemdesc{well1024a} from Francois Panneton, Pierre L'Ecuyer and
  Makoto Matsumoto. Period of about \verb!2^1024!, state given by an array of $32$
  integers (plus an index onto this array);
\item \itemdesc{fsultra} a Subtract-with-Borrow generator mixing with a congruential
  generator of Arif Zaman and George Marsaglia, period more than \verb!10^356!,
  state given by an array of 37 integers (plus an index onto this array, a flag (0 or 1)
  and another integer). 
\end{itemize}

Actions common to all generators are:
\begin{itemize}

\item \itemdesc{"getgen"}  \verb!S=grand("getgen")! returns the current base generator ( \verb!S! is
  a string among "mt", "kiss", "clcg2", "clcg4", "well1024a", "fsultra").
\item \itemdesc{action= "setgen"} \verb!grand("setgen",gen)! sets the current base generator to be \verb!gen!
  a string among "mt", "kiss", "clcg2", "clcg4", "well1024a", "fsultra" (notes that this call 
  returns the new current generator, ie gen).
\item \itemdesc{"getsd"} \verb!S=grand("getsd")! gets the current state of the current base
  generator ; \verb!S! is given as a column vector (of integers) of dimension \verb!625! 
  for mt (the first being an index in \verb![1,624]!), \verb!4! for kiss, \verb!2! 
  for clcg2,  \verb!40! for fsultra, \verb!4! for clcg4 (for this one
  you get the current state of the current virtual generator), \verb!33! for
  well1024a (the first being an index in \verb![1,32]!).
\item \itemdesc{"setsd"} \verb!grand("setsd",S)! sets the state of the current 
  base generator (the new seeds). $S$ is either a vector describing a
  complete state or only one integer (in this case a complete state for each
  generator is got from another random generator). 
\item \itemdesc{"phr2sd"} \verb!Sd=grand("phr2sd", phrase)! given a \verb!phrase! (character string) generates 
  a \verb!1 x 2! vector \verb!Sd! which may be used as seeds to change the state of a 
  base generator (initialy suited for clcg2). 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{How to set ``randomly'' the initial state}
~~\\

  To start the sequence from another point (that the one given by
 the default internally coded initial state), you can change the initial state using 
  \verb+grand("setsd",k)+ with a simple positive integer $k$ built from 
  the current day and time. This could be done this way:
\begin{mintednsp}{nsp}
//  To start ``randomly'' only the current generator
time = localtime(); 
// sum all entries of time
k=0; for key = time.__keys',k = k + time.find[key]; end 
// apply the new state
grand("setsd",k)

// To start ``randomly'' all the generators
time = localtime(); 
// sum all entries of time
k=0; for key = time.__keys',k = k + time.find[key]; end 
// apply the new state
gen = ["mt", "kiss", "clcg2", "clcg4", "well1024a", "fsultra"];
for g=gen; grand("setgen",g);grand("setsd",k);end
\end{mintednsp}



%-- section-Options specific to clcg4
\paragraph{Options specific to clcg4}
~~\\

The clcg4 generator may be used as the others generators but it offers the advantage 
to be splitted in several (\verb!101!) virtual generators with non over-lapping 
sequences (when you use a classic generator you may change the initial state (seeds) 
in order to get another sequence but you are not warranty to get a complete  different one). 
Each virtual generator corresponds to a sequence of \verb!2^72! values which is 
further split into \verb!V=2^31! segments (or blocks) of length \verb!W=2^41!.
For a given virtual generator you have the possibility to return at the beginning of the 
sequence or at the beginning of the current segment or to go directly at the next segment. 
You may also change the initial state (seed) of the generator \verb!0! with the 
"setall" option which then change also the initial state of the other virtual generators 
so as to get synchronisation (ie in function of the new initial state of gen \verb!0! 
the initial state of gen \verb!1..100! are recomputed so as to get \verb!101! 
non over-lapping sequences.   

\begin{itemize}
\item \itemdesc{"setcgn"} \verb!grand("setcgn",G)! sets the current virtual generator for clcg4 (when clcg4
  is set, this is the virtual (clcg4) generator number \verb!G! which is used);  the virtual clcg4 
  generators are numbered from \verb!0,1,..,100! (and so \verb!G! must be an integer 
  in  \verb![0,100]!) ; by default the current virtual generator is \verb!0!.
\item \itemdesc{"getcgn"} \verb!S=grand("getcgn")! returns the number of the current virtual clcg4 generator.
\item \itemdesc{"initgn"} \verb!grand("initgn",I)!
  reinitializes the state of the current virtual generator :
      \begin{itemize}
      \item \verb!I = -1! :sets the state to the initial seed
      \item \verb!I = 0! :sets the state to the beginning of the current segment
      \item \verb!I = 1! :sets the state to the beginning of the next segment
      \end{itemize}
\item \itemdesc{"setall"} \verb!grand("setall",s1,s2,s3,s4)! sets the initial state of generator \verb!0! 
  to \verb!s1,s2,s3,s4!. The initial seeds of the other generators are set accordingly 
  to have synchronisation. For constraints on \verb!s1, s2, s3, s4! see the "setsd" action.
\item \itemdesc{"advnst"} \verb!grand("advnst",K)! advances the state of the current generator by \verb!2^K! values 
  and  resets the initial seed to that value. 
\end{itemize}


%-- section-Test example for clcg4

\paragraph{Test example for clcg4}

An example of  the  need of the splitting capabilities of clcg4 is as  follows. 
Two statistical techniques are being compared on  data of  different sizes. The first 
technique uses   bootstrapping  and is   thought to   be  as accurate using less data   
than the second method   which  employs only brute force.  For the first method, a data
set of size uniformly distributed between 25 and 50 will be generated.  Then the data set  
of the specified size will be generated and analyzed.  The second method will  choose a 
data set size between 100 and 200, generate the data  and analyze it.  This process will 
be repeated 1000 times.  For  variance reduction, we  want the  random numbers  used in the 
two methods to be the  same for each of  the 1000 comparisons.  But method two will  use more
random  numbers than   method one and  without this package, synchronization might be difficult.  
With clcg4, it is a snap.  Use generator 0 to obtain  the sample size for  method one and 
generator 1  to obtain the  data.  Then reset the state to the beginning  of the current  block
and do the same  for the second method.  This assures that the initial data  for method two is 
that used by  method  one.  When both  have concluded,  advance the block for both generators.
