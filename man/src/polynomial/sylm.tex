%-- Calling sequence section

  [S]=sylm(a,b)  
\end{verbatim}
\end{calling_sequence}
%-- Parameters
\begin{parameters}
  \begin{varlist}
    \vname{a,b}: two polynomials
    \vname{S}: matrix
  \end{varlist}
\end{parameters}
\begin{mandescription}
  \verb!sylm(a,b)! gives the Sylvester matrix associated to polynomials
  \verb!a! and \verb!b!, i.e. the matrix \verb!S! such that:\verb!coeff( a*x + b*y )' = S * [coeff(x)';coeff(y)']!.
  Dimension of \verb!S! is equal to \verb!degree(a)+degree(b)!.
  If \verb!a! and \verb!b! are coprime polynomials then\verb!rank(sylm(a,b))=degree(a)+degree(b))! and the instructions
\begin{verbatim}
  u = sylm(a,b) \ eye(na+nb,1)
  x = poly(u(1:nb),'z','coeff')
  y = poly(u(nb+1:na+nb),'z','coeff')
\end{verbatim}
compute Bezout factors \verb!x! and \verb!y! of minimal degree 
such that \verb!a*x+b*y = 1!
\end{mandescription}
