  [C]=coeff(Mp [,v])

%-- Parameters
\begin{parameters}
  \begin{varlist}
    \vname{Mp}: polynomial matrix
    \vname{v}: integer (row or column) vector of selected degrees
    \vname{C}: big matrix of the coefficients
  \end{varlist}
\end{parameters}
\begin{mandescription}
  \verb!C=coeff(Mp)!
  returns in a big matrix \verb!C! the coefficients of the
  polynomial matrix \verb!Mp! . \verb!C! is partitioned
  as \verb!C=[C0,C1,...,Ck]! 
  where the \verb!Ci! are arranged in increasing order 
  \verb!k = maxi(degree(Mp))!\verb!C=coeff(Mp,v)! returns the matrix of coefficients with 
  degree in \verb!v! . (\verb!v! is a row or column vector).
