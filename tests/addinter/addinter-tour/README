This directory contains examples of C interface routines
which are used to build a shared library.
The shared library is dynamically linked using addinter 

For building a library of your own you have to provide 
your own interfaces and to write a specific builder.sce.
You can take a look at addinter-tutorial which is simpler.

-------------------------------------------------------
To build the shared library enter 
	--> exec builder.sce 
	at scilab prompt 
To load the shared library enter 
	--> exec loader.sce 
	at scilab prompt 
To run a test just exec the corresponding .sce file

You can also build and run all the tests with 
	make tests (Unix) 
	nmake /f Makefile.mak tests (visual C++) 
-------------------------------------------------------

ex01*: An interface with the function ex1* . Shows how to pass
	integer, float or double arrays and strings to a C or Fortran 
	function. 

ex02*: Passing a complex array to the interface.

ex03*: Passing a boolean matrix to the interface.

ex04*: interfacing C function which creates objects on the execution stack 
	(with malloc). How to transfer these objects to Scilab
       	Interfaces are given in C and Fortran but the functions 
       	which are to be interfaced are only given in C (they use malloc)
       	We give examples with C allocated double array, int array, char array.

ex05*:	Passing string matrices. 

ex06*:  Passing sparse matrices. 

ex07* : Passing lists
