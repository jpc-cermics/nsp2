fec is used to plot contour level of a function defined on a mesh constituted of
triangles and assuming that f is linear on triangles

The best way to undersantd how it works is to look at the demo files 
in demos/graphics/fec 

Fec is used as folows : let no be the number of nodes and Ntr the number of triangles 

fec(x,y,triangles,func,no,Ntr,...)

	x and y are two vectors of size no 
		 (x(i),y(i)) gives the coordinates of node i 
	func is also a vector of size no : 
		func(i) gives the value of the function for which we want
		the level curves.

	trianles : is a [Ntr,5] matrix 
		each line of triangles specifies a triangle of the mesh 
		triangle(j) = [number,node1,node2,node3,flag]
		node1,node2,node3 : are the number of the nodes 
		which constitues triangle(j)
		number : is the number of the triangle 
		flag is an integer not used in the fec function 

===================================================================


fec1.sce: is a simple demo file in which a mesh and a function 
	  on that mesh is completely built in nsp syntax. 

fec2.sce: is an example for which the mesh and the function value where 
	  computed by an external `mesh builder  (amdba type mesh) and external program 
	  A set of macros ( provided in file macros.sci) are used to read the to data files
	  and plot the results.

fec3.sce: an other example

fec4.sce: an example which illustrate the available options.
