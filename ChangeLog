	* src/objects/object.c: 
	a generic eq (==) and ne (<>) added 
	in object for dealing with a==b and a<>b when 
	a and b do not share the same type.
	A method equal was also added obj1.equal[obj2] 
	test that obj1 and obj2 are copies 
	(same semantic as and(obj1==obj2))

	* src/lapack added. It contains a set 
	of lapack based function (qr,svd,inv,...) 
	and their interfaces. This is unfinished and 
	not fully tested.
